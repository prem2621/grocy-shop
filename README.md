## 📖 My Journey Note

> 🛤️ *"This is where it all began... My first project.*  
> *Yes, it had naming mistakes, no `img/` folder, and everything was globally dumped 😅.*  
> *But that’s okay — because from this starting point, I’ve grown. Now, I understand structure, clarity, and clean code better.*  
> *So if you're reading this: Don't wait to be perfect to start — start, and stay consistent. That’s how you become perfect."*

🙏 Thank you for taking time to view my project and witness my growth.

🌟 “Every expert was once a beginner. Grocy Shops is where my journey began.”
